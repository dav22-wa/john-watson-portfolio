# John Watson Portfolio

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive portfolio website for John Watson, a web designer and UI/UX developer.

The site is designed to be visually appealing, accessible, and fully functional across devices.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with local storage persistence.
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth scrolling, skill bar animations, and stats counter.
- **Contact Form**: Client-side validation for name, email, and message fields.
- **Creative Additions**:
  - Parallax effect on the hero section.
  - Scroll progress indicator.
  - Download CV button (placeholder PDF).
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles with CSS variables and media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and animations.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive grid and components.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for services and social media.

## Solution Approach
1. **Planning**: Sketched wireframes and defined features based on the rubric.
2. **Development**:
   - Separated concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for interactivity).
   - Used Bootstrap for rapid prototyping and responsiveness.
   - Added creative features (parallax, scroll progress) to stand out.
3. **Testing**:
   - Tested responsiveness on Chrome DevTools and physical devices.
   - Validated accessibility using Lighthouse.
   - Ensured cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
4. **Documentation**: Wrote a detailed README to explain setup, contributions, and demo.
